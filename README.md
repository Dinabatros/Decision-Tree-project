Decision Tree Lab


In this lab, part of the Machine Learning with Python course on Coursera, I am actively enhancing my expertise in machine learning algorithms, with a focus on the Decision Tree model. This hands-on experience allows me to deepen my understanding of classification techniques and their applications in real-world scenarios.

By engaging with this course, I aim to develop a solid foundation in machine learning principles that will empower me to implement effective solutions in my future career as a Data Scientist. This project not only bolsters my technical skills but also strengthens my analytical thinking and problem-solving abilities, preparing me for the challenges in the data science field.
